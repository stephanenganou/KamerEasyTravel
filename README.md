Is a B2B platform I developed using Node.js now I am moving it to Spring boot 2 (with Java 17) and React.js.
The complete application is build using a micro-service Architecture! [See Architecture: file "Architekture_Overview"]

## Status: Still on Development (not done yet). But both projects (Node.js and Java Spring boot will remain private).

## Old Technology Stack:
	-> Node.js
	-> Express (for routing and etc.)
	-> Handlebars (to render UI)
	-> passport.js (handles 3rd party authentications such as "Facebook", "Google", "Paypal" and etc.)
	-> 2-Authentication process
	-> Axios.js (handle communication calls between micro-services and also REST calls in UI)
	-> SSL
	-> For deployment and load-balancing: Docker, PM2, Nginx
	-> Winston (for loggings etc.)
